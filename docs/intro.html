        <h2 id="a-brief-history-of-computer-audio-and-muse">A brief history of computer audio and MusE</h2>
        <p>To quickly summarize over a decade (two decades!) of open source development:</p>
        <p>In the early days of 2000 Werner Schweer released the first version of MusE as the package muse-0.0.1.tar.gz. In it’s first few releases (actually not few, Werner relentlessly churned out new releases) MusE was only a midi sequencer. The target was to create a fully fledged midi sequencer for the Linux operating system. Over the years audio was added among with other things implemented and sometimes abandoned. Today MusE is a stable and feature rich music creation environment which strives to encompass most of the music recording process, creation, editing, mixing, mastering.</p>
        <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
        <p><strong>CTRL</strong> refers to the control key on the keyboard, e.g. <strong>CTRL+C</strong> means to press and hold the control key while pressing the c key. Make sure you know where you have it so you won’t accidentally lose control (bad jokes are the best jokes, so say we all!).<br />
        <strong>SHIFT</strong> refers to the shift key on the keyboard, see above for usage<br />
        <strong>ALT</strong> refers to the alt key on the keyboard, see above for usage<br />
        <code>$&gt;</code> is used as a generic definition for a terminal prompt. When the manual lists a command that shall be typed, the prompt is not part of the command.<br />
        Keys are always referred to in bold uppercase, e.g. <strong>A</strong>. For instance <strong>SHIFT+A</strong> for the key a pressed together with the shift key.<br />
        Sometimes terminal examples are written tabbed in with a fixed font to visualize more closely what something looks like on the screen. E.g.<br />
        <code>$&gt; muse4</code></p>
