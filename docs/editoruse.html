    <h2 id="drum-editor-creating-moving-resizing-copying-deleting-drum-notes">Drum editor: Creating, moving, resizing, copying, deleting drum notes</h2>
    <p>Prior to drawing new drum notes, press: * Ctrl + Meta: Draw with velocity level 1. * Meta: Draw with velocity level 2. * No keys/buttons: Draw with velocity level 3. * Meta + Alt: Draw with velocity level 4.</p>
    <p>While drawing a new drum note, press: * No keys/buttons: Note can move horizontally and vertically. Note snaps to the grid. * Shift: Do not snap to the grid.</p>
    <p>Moving or copying existing drum notes by dragging them:</p>
    <p>Prior to dragging the drum notes, press: * Shift: Constricts movement horizontally or vertically. * Ctrl: A copy of the notes will be made.</p>
    <p>While dragging the drum notes, press: * Shift: Do not snap to grid.</p>
    <p>The pencil tool will not resize a drum note, it moves the note. Press: * Shift: Do not snap to grid.</p>
    <p>To delete a drum note, press: * Middle-click/Delete: Delete note.</p>
    <h2 id="pianoroll-and-drum-editors-midi-controller-graph-area">Pianoroll and Drum Editors: Midi controller graph area</h2>
    <p>On these areas you can draw and erase midi controller graphs. Lines can also be drawn.</p>
    <p>TBD: Operations and keys.</p>
    <p>The midi controller graphs offer full cut/copy/paste and drag/drop. Unlike the note or drum canvases, the controller graph canvases cannot allow more than one item at a given position. Thus you cannot simply drag and drop some pieces of the controller graph onto existing pieces and let them co-exist. Therefore, there is an additional step after dropping the items called MERGING. Click in a blank area or on a new graph item to ‘merge’ the dragged items. A right-click context menu is provided with a ‘Merge’, ‘Merge a copy’, and ‘Cancel drag’. Also, at any time before the merge, you may press ‘Control’ to change the ‘Merge’ mouse cursor into a ‘Merge Copy’ cursor.</p>
    <p>The reason behind it, is that you can drop the items somewhere, release the mouse, and then continue dragging them further before you choose to merge them. It allows you to say, zoom or scroll and then continue moving the items before merging. (If we were to merge immediately after dropping each time, you would end up with a trail of erased existing items underneath until there’s nothing left of your graph.) There are options for merging, found in the right-click controller graph context menu, and in the newly revamped ‘paste with dialog’ found in the edit menus. There you can choose exactly how existing items are erased when the dragged or pasted items are merged. (Bitmap icons try to show what happens with each of the options.)</p>
    <h2 id="wave-editor-creating-moving-resizing-copying-deleting-wave-events">Wave editor: Creating, moving, resizing, copying, deleting wave events</h2>
    <p>While drawing a new wave event, press: * No keys/buttons: Event is resized horizontally in-place. * Right-click/Ctrl: Move event horizontally, don’t resize. Event snaps to the grid. * Right-click/Ctrl + Shift: Same as Right-click/Ctrl, but do not snap to the grid.</p>
    <p>Moving or copying existing wave events by dragging them:</p>
    <p>Prior to dragging the events, press: * Ctrl: A copy of the events will be made.</p>
    <p>While dragging the events, press: * Shift: Do not snap to grid. (Sample-accurate resolution.)</p>
    <p>While resizing a wave event with the pencil tool, press: * Shift: Do not snap the event’s right border to the grid.</p>
    <p>To resize a wave event with the pointer tool, press: * Right-click + Ctrl: Resize event. * Right-click + Ctrl + Shift: Do not snap the event’s right border to the grid.</p>
    <p>To delete a wave event, press: * Middle-click/Delete: Delete event.</p>
    <h2 id="panning-and-zooming-the-editors">Panning and Zooming the editors</h2>
    <p>There are different ways to pan and zoom:</p>
    <p>The default shortcut keys H and L pan the Pianoroll, Drum Editor, and Wave Editor right and left.</p>
    <p>Shift + Mouse Wheel pans the Arranger, Pianoroll, Drum Editor, and Wave Editor.</p>
    <p>The Pan tool (hand) lets you pan just by dragging the canvases.</p>
    <p>Hold Shift to constrict movement vertically. Hold Ctrl to constrict movement horizontally.</p>
    <p>And the horizontal scroll bars obviously pan all windows as well.</p>
    <p>The default shortcut keys Ctrl + PageUp and Ctrl + PageDown zoom the Arranger, Pianoroll, Drum Editor, and Wave Editor about the mouse cursor position.</p>
    <p>Ctrl + Mouse Wheel also zooms these editors, about the mouse cursor position.</p>
    <p>The Zoom tool (magnifier) lets you zoom just by dragging the canvases.</p>
    <p>And the horizontal magnification scroll bars obviously zoom as well, but they do not zoom about any cursor, they zoom from the left edge.</p>
    <p>By default, the Pan and Zoom tools have continuous, borderless motion, using a special coding technique. This is great for track-ball mice for example, because it lets you keep rolling and rolling without border limits!</p>
    <p>An alternate, more standard method is available by un-checking “Borderless zoom/pan” in Global Settings -&gt; GUI Behaviour. This method does present border limitations on how far you can move before you must reposition the mouse.</p>
