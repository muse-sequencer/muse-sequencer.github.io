        <p>MusE is foremost available for Linux, we hope it's just a matter of time before it is ported to your (other) favourite platform.</p>
        <h2 id="download_linux_binaries">Linux Binaries</h2>
        <p>MusE should be available for most distributions in the default repository, the actual procedure to install MusE from the respective
        source is outside the scope of this page. (There is some likely outdated info below in the <strong>Binaries</strong> chapter about
        installation for various distributions.)</p>
        <p>If your distribution only has an old version you can install it from source <strong>follow the instructions below</strong>.</p>
        <h2 id="download_appimage">AppImage</h2>
        <p>There is now AppImage available for the latest development release (master)
        <a href="https://github.com/muse-sequencer/muse/releases/download/latest/MusE-master-x86_64.AppImage">here</a></p>
        <h2 id="download_source">Source</h2>
        <h3 id="download_source_stable_releases">Stable releases</h3>
        <p>Stable source releases can now be found <a href="https://github.com/muse-sequencer/muse/releases">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Releases prior to 3.1 are available <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lmuse/files">here</a>.</p>
        <p>For information about how to compile MusE from <strong>source</strong> see the README file in the package!</p>
        <h3 id="download_source_developer_releases">Developer releases</h3>
        <p>Our development happens here on github, checkout the git repository on the base page.</p>
        <p>Instructions are <a href="https://github.com/muse-sequencer/muse">here</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="download_distro_binaries">Distribution binaries</h2>
        <p>If you don't want to compile your software on your own, a prebuild binary would be the best way to install MusE.
        They should be available for most Linux distributions.</p>
        <h3 id="download_debian">DEB</h3>
        <p>Check your distributions repository, no specific info at this moment.</p>
        <p>From the command line this is usually done with a command like one of these:</p>
        <p><code> sudo apt-get install muse</code></p>
        <p><code> sudo apt-get install museseq</code></p>
        <p><code> sudo aptitude install muse</code></p>
        <p>There is probably a graphical package manager than makes it more user friendly.</p>
        <h3 id="download_rpm">RPM</h3>
        <p>Check your distributions repository, no specific info at this moment.</p>
        <p>From the command line this is usually done with a command like one of these:</p>
        <p><code> yum install muse</code> (in fedora based distros)</p>
        <p>There is probably a graphical packet manager than makes it more user friendly.</p>
